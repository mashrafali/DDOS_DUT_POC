# DDOS_DUT_POC
Distributed Denial Of Service: Device Under Test Proof Of Concept (DDOS DUT POC)

# Introduction

- In this project we needed to deploy a lab environment in order to test DDOS DUTs.
- Standards were needed to be adjusted for all DUTs testing, where all DUTs were to be tested on common grounds.
- A near real life scenarios needed to be tested and calibrated with given DUTs.
## The main requirements
1- Deploy a victim system, with almost all well known services configured and deployed.
2- Deploy An Attacker System capable of Utilizing and deploying several Layer-4 & 7 DDOS Attacks.
3- Deploy a Client System, where it well generate and request Legitimate traffic in correspondence with the Victim.
4- Deploy a Calibration System, in order to act as a dependable performance measurement through out all the phases of the POC.
